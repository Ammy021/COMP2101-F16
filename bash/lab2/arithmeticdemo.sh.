This is what i have learned in class today.

$firstnum plus $secondnum equals $((firstnum + secondnum))
$firstnum minus $secondnum equals $((firstnum - secondnum))
$firstnum times $secondnum equals $((firstnum * secondnum))
$firstnum divided by $secondnum equals $((firstnum / secondnum))
$firstnum divided by $secondnum leaves a remainder $((firstnum % secondnum))
